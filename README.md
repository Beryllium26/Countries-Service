# Countries-Service
micro-service that return a list of valid countries that currency can be transferred from or transferred to.

This is a JSON 'REST' API written in go for the express purpose of an exercise I have been asked to do. I had never used 'go' before but I felt that picking what I felt was one of the best tool for the job, was worth the challenge.

It exposes a single location resource fro the api:  /api/v1/

An about page is available at /about and /

Install gocheck ( http://gopkg.in/check.v1 ) as the internal testing library is relatively slim, and we could do with some of the nice features that gocheck provides: http://labix.org/gocheck
