# Countries-Service
micro-services that return a list of valid countries that currency can be transferred from or transferred to

This is a JSON 'REST' API written in go for the express purpose of an exercise I have been asked to do. I had never used go before but I felt that picking what I felt was one of the best tool for the job, was worth the challenge.

It exposes a single location resource:  /api/v1/

An about page is available at: /about

# start the http server

Testing

Install gocheck ( http://gopkg.in/check.v1 ) as the internal testing library is relatively slim, and we could do with some of the nice fearures that gocheck provides: http://labix.org/gocheck
